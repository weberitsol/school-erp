# 📚 School ERP + Mobile Offline App - Complete Project Documentation

**Status**: ✅ **PLANNING PHASE COMPLETE - READY FOR TEAM REVIEW**
**Date**: 2025-12-27
**Project Scope**: 19 Epics | 150+ Stories | ~650 Story Points | 16 Weeks

---

## 🎯 QUICK START

### What is This Project?
The School ERP platform is being enhanced with a **revolutionary offline-first mobile testing system** that solves critical scalability issues. Instead of 10,000 students crashing the system when taking exams simultaneously, they can now:

1. **Download** tests once (no internet needed)
2. **Take tests offline** (instant responses, zero server load)
3. **Sync results** when convenient
4. **Evaluate in batch** (1-2 hours later, not real-time)

**Result**: Perfect scalability with amazing user experience.

### Key Numbers
- **Web Platform**: 10 existing epics (~68 stories) - partially done
- **Mobile App**: 8 new epics (~53 stories) - new development
- **Proctoring System**: 1 new epic (15 stories) - optional
- **Timeline**: 16 weeks with 8-developer team
- **Effort**: ~650 story points

## ❓ FAQ

### **Q: Why offline-first mobile app?**
A: Solves scalability. Current system crashes at 10K concurrent. Offline app = 0 server load during tests, unlimited scale.

### **Q: What about proctoring?**
A: Added as Epic 19. Real-time monitoring for high-stakes exams. Can be Phase 4+ addition.

### **Q: How long does this take?**
A: 16 weeks with 8 developers. Broken into 4 phases of 4 weeks each.

### **Q: What if we don't do all epics?**
A: Flexible! MVP is first 4 weeks (Phase 1) = foundation. Phase 2-4 are optional but recommended.

### **Q: Can we do this with fewer people?**
A: Yes, but slower. 5 devs = 5 months. 10 devs = 3 months. Adjust based on capacity.

### **Q: What about existing web platform?**
A: Continues in parallel. Mobile is new. Web gets enhanced (Epics 1-10) as needed.
